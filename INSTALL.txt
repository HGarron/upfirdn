To install this package in the current directory, type
  make
The tests can be run with
  python test_upfirdn.py

To install in the site-packages area of your python installation, type
  python setup.py install
HOWEVER - use this option with CAUTION, as I am new to using distutils, 
and this is not quite providing a clean package - it copies
all of the python modules and .so file directly to site-packages, rather
than in a subdirectory there.  Also, I had to run this command a second
time to get the swig python module (Resampler.py) to get copied; and
the tests ran but then had a nose failure at the end.  These issues
will be cleaned up in a subsequent version of upfirdn.
